      <h2>Blender: Solar System</h2>
      <p>
        Blender: Solar System refers to a 3D modeling and animation project created using Blender, a free and open-source 3D creation software. In this project, the solar system is digitally represented, including the Sun, planets, moons, and their orbital paths. The simulation often includes realistic textures, lighting effects, and animations that demonstrate planetary rotation and revolution. This type of project is commonly used in educational settings, science visualizations, or creative work to help users better understand the structure and motion of our solar system. Blender provides tools such as keyframe animation, lighting, and camera control to make the solar system appear both accurate and visually engaging.

      <h2>Rotoscoping</h2>
      <p>
        Rotoscoping is a visual effects and animation technique where artists manually trace over live-action footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic motion or to isolate specific elements within a video. Originally developed for traditional animation, rotoscoping is now widely used in film, television, and digital media. It allows creators to separate subjects from their backgrounds, add special effects, or create stylized animations based on real movement. Modern rotoscoping is often done using digital tools in software like Adobe After Effects, Blender, or Nuke. The technique is essential for compositing, object removal, and artistic projects that blend live action with animation.
